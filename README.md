### âœ¨ Simplified android template project for Android Studio without boilerplate code
Clone it and run your simple project without trash.

ðŸ¤” In many reasons i have created this repository. 
- I need to stay up to date with core libraries and SDKs. 
- I need my own template project for my purposes and full control.
- Android Studio generates too many boilerplate code.
- Android Studio generates unnecessary code and i don't want to delete it every time.
